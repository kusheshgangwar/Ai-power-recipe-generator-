#AI POWER RECIPE GENERATOR


An AI-powered recipe generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can take user input (such as available ingredients or dietary preferences) and suggest recipes using AI. Here's how you can build it:

#Frontend (HTML + CSS)

Create an input form where users enter ingredients or select dietary preferences.

Use CSS to style the page for a clean and user-friendly interface.


#JavaScript for Logic

Use JavaScript to handle user input and send a request to an AI API (like OpenAI's GPT or a recipe database API).

Process the AI response and display suggested recipes dynamically.


#AI Integration

You can either use a predefined recipe dataset or integrate an AI model (like OpenAI API) to generate recipes based on user input.
