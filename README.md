AI POWER RECIPE GENERATOR
--------------------------


An AI-powered recipe generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can take user input (such as available ingredients or dietary preferences) and suggest recipes using AI. Here's how you can build it:

1.Frontend (HTML + CSS)
-----------------------

Create an input form where users enter ingredients or select dietary preferences.

Use CSS to style the page for a clean and user-friendly interface.


2.JavaScript for Logic
----------------------

Use JavaScript to handle user input and send a request to an AI API (like OpenAI's GPT or a recipe database API).

Process the AI response and display suggested recipes dynamically.


3.AI Integration
-----------------

You can either use a predefined recipe dataset or integrate an AI model (like OpenAI API) to generate recipes based on user input.
